## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.24.1] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- Bundle Microsoft's Evergreen WebView2 bootstrapper in the Inno installer and install WebView2 Runtime silently on clean Windows machines before launching CodexBar.

---

## [0.24.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- Ported upstream CodexBar 0.24 provider support for Codebuff, DeepSeek, and Windsurf to the Windows/Tauri Rust backend.
- Added Codebuff and DeepSeek API-key provider configuration, CLI aliases, credential metadata, icons, and chart colors.
- Added Windsurf local cached-plan usage support using the platform application-data `state.vscdb` cache.

### Changed
- Updated app/package versions and provider catalog metadata for the 0.24.0 Windows release.

---

## [0.23.11] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- Handle Claude Web usage payloads that include overlapping design or routines alias fields without failing with a duplicate-field parse error.
- Keep Claude Web parse diagnostics useful without exposing raw response bodies in user-facing errors or logs.

---

## [0.23.10] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- Route active Claude OAuth token accounts through OAuth mode and pass the selected token directly into the Claude OAuth fetcher.
- Keep Claude `sessionKey` token accounts on the web/cookie path instead of confusing them with OAuth tokens.
- Report OAuth, Web, and CLI failures together in Claude Auto mode so a final CLI parse error no longer hides earlier token or cookie failures.

---

## [0.23.7] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Parse Claude CLI's exhausted `You've hit your limit · resets ...` short form as full session usage instead of reporting `Claude CLI did not return usage data`.
- Make Claude CLI usage parsing more tolerant of compact labels, decimal percentages, and remaining/available wording.
- Keep weekly reset lines from being promoted into the session reset when the session section has no reset.

### Security
- Re-enable the Tauri content security policy and disable global Tauri injection.
- Narrow the default Tauri capability permissions to the event, window, and global shortcut APIs the frontend actually uses.
- Harden external URL opening by validating web URLs and avoiding `cmd /c start` on Windows.

---

## [0.23.6] — 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- Use active token accounts during provider refresh so Cursor, Ollama, and other cookie-token providers fetch via web cookies instead of falling back to unsupported CLI mode.

---

## [0.23.5] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- Added safe diagnostics and credential storage status reporting for the Tauri shell without exposing secret values.
- Added a Windows installer smoke-test script for silent install, installed-file, registry, shortcut, and uninstall validation.

### Changed
- Reused fresh provider refresh results during startup and panel opening to reduce avoidable provider fetches.

### Fixed
- Redacted secret-like values from provider refresh errors before they cross the Tauri bridge.
- Re-verify downloaded installer SHA-256 hashes immediately before applying an update.
- Hardened desktop command inputs for provider IDs, credential values, cookie source values, region values, token accounts, and filesystem paths.

---
## [1.2.12] — 2026-04-04

### Security
- Harden updater integrity checks with SHA256 digest validation (PR #24)
- Harden CLI binary resolution against CWD hijacking (PR #26)
- Harden Kiro CLI path resolution with PATH support and filename validation (PR #25)
- Verify VC++ runtime signature/checksum before packaging (PR #23)

### Added
- Add Infini AI Coding Plan provider support with 5-hour/7-day/30-day usage windows (PR #28)

### Fixed
- Fix Windows CLI visibility - `codexbar.exe usage` now produces output in PowerShell (Issue #22)
- Fix Claude `.local/bin` path detection for Windows native installs (Issue #22)
- Fix Claude auto-source error reporting to surface auth errors before CLI timeout (Issue #22)
- Fix Infini provider `with_base_url()` being ignored in `fetch_usage()` (PR #28 fix)
- Fix Kiro provider PATH lookup removal that regressed WSL/Linux support (PR #25 fix)

---
## [1.2.10] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- Added NanoGPT as a supported provider on current `main`, including daily/monthly usage parsing and the related Windows preferences wiring.

### Fixed
- Aligned the CLI help text with the actual supported provider set so `nanogpt` now appears in both top-level help and `codexbar usage --help`.

---
## [1.2.9] — 2026-04-03

### Changed
- Added a Summary view to the Windows popup so enabled providers can be scanned together without switching cards one by one, while keeping the native Windows title bar and resize behavior intact.
- Replaced the stale root Swift CI and Linux release workflows with Rust-native automation that validates and packages the `codexbar` binary from `rust/`.

### Fixed
- Claude web usage fetching now accepts `CLAUDE_AI_SESSION_KEY` and `CLAUDE_WEB_SESSION_KEY` values as either raw session tokens or `sessionKey=...`, and it sends the shared browser-style headers Claude expects on every API request.
- Localized the new Summary-view strings in both English and Chinese instead of shipping hardcoded English labels.

---

## [1.2.8] — 2026-03-31

### Changed
- The Windows installer now bundles Microsoft's Visual C++ redistributable and installs it before launching CodexBar on clean machines.

### Fixed
- Fixed clean-Windows installer runs failing to launch CodexBar because the required Visual C++ runtime was missing.

---

## [1.2.7] — 2026-03-31

### Changed
- Completed the Windows updater flow so update checks, background downloads, and quit-time install behavior use the same settings and release asset selection rules.

### Fixed
- Wired the existing `install_updates_on_quit` setting into the actual Windows quit path instead of leaving it as a dead preference.
- Added visible General -> Updates controls for auto-download and quit-time install behavior in both English and Chinese.
- Hardened pending installer detection so cached portable executables and stale/current-version installers are ignored, while the newest newer installer is preferred.
- Fixed manual Check for Updates to respect the same auto-download behavior as startup checks and added a guard to prevent overlapping installer downloads.
- Added coverage for pending-installer selection and beta-style installer names in the updater tests.

---

## [1.2.6] — 2026-03-31

### Changed
- Hardened the Windows release path by restoring the installer/portable asset flow and cleaning up repo-wide lint debt so the Rust quality gates stay green.

### Fixed
- Added a clear Windows Remote Desktop startup guard so the app shows a direct dialog instead of failing with opaque renderer errors.
- Completed the Windows localization/auth recovery cleanup from the outstanding PR work and shipped the Claude parsing/update-path fixes in the merged codebase.

---

## [1.2.5] — 2026-03-29

### Added
- Windows now loads common Simplified Chinese font fallbacks so localized UI text renders correctly instead of missing glyph boxes.

### Changed
- Localized major Windows UI surfaces to Simplified Chinese, including the main window, tray menus/tooltips, provider detail actions, and settings sections.

### Fixed
- Reset/usage/status strings now display correctly in the localized Windows UI instead of mixing untranslated English labels through key flows.
