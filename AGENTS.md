# Repository Guidelines

## Current Project State
- This branch launches the Tauri desktop shell by default (`apps/desktop-tauri/src-tauri`), while
  `rust/` remains the shared backend/domain crate and standalone CLI.
- Many files in `docs/` and some workflows reference the upstream macOS/Swift project. Treat those as historical or
  upstream-sync material unless the task is explicitly about upstream parity.
- When repo docs conflict, trust the active Tauri desktop sources in `apps/desktop-tauri` plus the shared Rust sources
  in `rust/src`.

## Project Structure & Modules
- `apps/desktop-tauri/`: Tauri desktop shell (default UI). React frontend in `apps/desktop-tauri/src/`,
  Rust backend + tray bridge in `apps/desktop-tauri/src-tauri/src/`.
- `rust/src`: Shared backend crate + CLI (`codexbar` binary). Houses providers, settings, login,
  status, sound, shortcuts, browser cookie extraction, and the shared tray-icon renderer.
- `rust/src/providers`: Provider-specific fetch/parsing/auth logic. Keep provider boundaries clean.
- `rust/src/tray` (shared): `icon.rs` + `render.rs` — pixel-level tray-icon rendering used by the Tauri shell.
- `rust/src/browser`: Browser detection + cookie extraction for Windows.
- `rust/src/core`: Shared provider-construction (`instantiate_provider`) and provider IDs.
- `rust/assets`, `rust/icons`, `rust/gen`, `rust/wix`: UI assets, generated schemas, installer packaging.
- `docs`: Mixed documentation (Windows port docs plus upstream/macOS references). Update only the relevant docs.

## Build, Test, Run
- Default desktop work runs from the repo root; `cd rust` is for backend/CLI-only tasks.
- Build the desktop shell (preferred): `cd apps/desktop-tauri && npm run tauri:build` (or `tauri:build:debug`).
  Raw `cargo build --release` on the Tauri crate produces an exe that still points at the dev URL.
- Build the CLI: `cargo build -p codexbar`.
- Test: `cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml` and
  `cargo test --manifest-path apps/desktop-tauri/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
- Run CLI locally: `cargo run -p codexbar -- --help`, `cargo run -p codexbar -- usage -p claude`,
  `cargo run -p codexbar -- cost`. The CLI no longer launches a GUI when run with no subcommand.
- Run the desktop shell through Tauri's build/dev flow: `.\dev.ps1`, `./dev.sh`, or
  `cd apps/desktop-tauri && npm run tauri:dev`.
- Format/lint before handoff when code changed: `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  on both manifests (or explain why not run).
- There is no active root-level `Scripts/` build pipeline in this port. Do not rely on legacy `Scripts/*.sh` commands.

## Coding Style & Naming
- Prefer small, typed structs/enums and focused modules; keep changes local.
- Keep provider-specific logic inside the provider module instead of adding cross-provider branching.
- Preserve clear error handling and user-facing diagnostics (`anyhow`/`thiserror` + friendly messages where applicable).
- Use `tracing` for diagnostics; do not log raw secrets, cookies, or tokens.
- Avoid adding dependencies/tooling without confirmation.

## Testing Guidelines
- Add or extend focused Rust tests near the changed module (`#[cfg(test)]` unit tests are common in this repo).
- For parser/fetcher changes, add deterministic samples/fixtures where practical.
- Run `cargo test` after code changes; include any skipped checks in handoff.
- If desktop/tray behavior changed, do a manual validation with the Tauri shell when possible (`cargo run` or
  `codexbar-desktop-tauri`).

## Commit & PR Guidelines
- Use short imperative commit messages (for example: `Fix Claude CLI parser`, `Improve cookie import errors`).
- Keep commits scoped to one change.
- In PRs/patches, include:
  - Summary of behavior changes
  - Commands run (`cargo test`, `cargo fmt`, etc.)
  - Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes (Windows)
  - Linked issue/reference when relevant

## Agent Notes
- The default desktop app is the Tauri shell in `apps/desktop-tauri/`. The Rust crate owns shared backend logic
  and the CLI.
- New provider construction goes through `codexbar::core::instantiate_provider` — do not duplicate provider
  factories in shells or commands.
- Keep provider data siloed: never show identity/plan/email fields from provider A in provider B UI.
- Claude CLI output is user-configurable; do not depend on a customizable status line for usage parsing.
- Cookie import UX uses explicit browser selection in Preferences. Do not assume Chrome-only in general UI flows.
- Be conservative with secret handling (manual cookies, API keys, token accounts); use existing redaction/storage helpers.
- Prefer Windows-native validation for tray/DPAPI/browser-cookie behavior; WSL/Linux can be insufficient for those paths.
