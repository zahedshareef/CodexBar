# Quotio Analysis & Pattern Adaptation

**Purpose:** Learn from quotio's implementation patterns without copying code  
**Repository:** https://github.com/nguyenphutrong/quotio  
**Approach:** Analyze patterns, implement independently

---

## 🎯 Analysis Goals

### What We're Looking For
1. **UI/UX Patterns** - Menu organization, settings layout, status displays
2. **Multi-Account Management** - How they handle multiple accounts per provider
3. **Session Management** - Cookie handling, OAuth flows, session persistence
4. **Provider Architecture** - How providers are structured and managed
5. **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages and recovery
6. **Performance Optimizations** - Caching, background updates, efficiency

### What We're NOT Doing
- ❌ Copying code verbatim
- ❌ Replicating their exact UI
- ❌ Using their assets or branding
- ❌ Violating their license

### What We ARE Doing
- ✅ Learning from their architectural decisions
- ✅ Understanding their UX patterns
- ✅ Adapting concepts to CodexBar conventions
- ✅ Implementing independently with our own code
- ✅ Crediting inspiration appropriately

## 🔍 Analysis Process

### Step 1: Repository Overview

```bash
# Fetch latest quotio
./Scripts/analyze_quotio.sh

# Review file structure
git ls-tree -r --name-only quotio/main | grep -E '\.(swift|md)$'

# Check recent activity
git log --oneline --graph quotio/main --since="30 days ago"
```

### Step 2: Feature Comparison

Create a comparison matrix:

| Feature | CodexBar | Quotio | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| Multi-account | ❌ | ✅ | Priority for fork |
| Provider count | 5 | ? | Check quotio |
| Cookie import | ✅ | ? | Compare approaches |
| OAuth support | ✅ | ? | Compare flows |
| Session keepalive | ✅ | ? | Compare strategies |
| Menu bar UI | Basic | ? | Compare organization |
| Settings UI | Tabs | ? | Compare layout |

### Step 3: Deep Dive Areas

#### Multi-Account Management
```bash
# Find account-related files
git ls-tree -r --name-only quotio/main | grep -i account

# View implementation (read-only)
git show quotio/main:path/to/AccountManager.swift

# Document patterns in this file (see below)
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- How are accounts stored? (Keychain, file, database?)
- How is the active account selected?
- How does UI show multiple accounts?
- How are credentials isolated per account?
- How does account switching work?

#### Session Management
```bash
# Find session-related files
git ls-tree -r --name-only quotio/main | grep -iE '(session|cookie|auth)'

# Review implementation
git show quotio/main:path/to/SessionManager.swift
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- How are cookies refreshed?
- How is session expiration detected?
- How are multiple sessions managed?
- What's the keepalive strategy?
- How are errors handled?

#### UI/UX Patterns
```bash
# Find UI files
git ls-tree -r --name-only quotio/main | grep -iE '(view|menu|ui)'

# Review layouts
git show quotio/main:path/to/MenuBarView.swift
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- How is the menu bar organized?
- How are multiple accounts displayed?
- What status indicators are used?
- How are settings organized?
- What's the navigation pattern?

## 🎨 Pattern Examples

### Example 1: Multi-Account UI Pattern

**Quotio Pattern (Observed):**
- Dropdown menu in menu bar
- Account nickname/email display
- Active account indicator
- Quick switch action

**CodexBar Adaptation:**
```swift
// Our implementation (example)
struct AccountSwitcherView: View {
    @Bindable var store: UsageStore
    
    var body: some View {
        Menu {
            ForEach(store.accounts) { account in
                Button {
                    store.switchAccount(account)
                } label: {
                    HStack {
                        Text(account.displayName)
                        if account.isActive {
                            Image(systemName: "checkmark")
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        } label: {
            // Menu bar icon
        }
    }
}

// Inspired by quotio's account switching UI pattern
// Implemented using SwiftUI and CodexBar's UsageStore
```

### Example 2: Session Persistence Pattern

**Quotio Pattern (Observed):**
- Automatic session restoration
- Background refresh
- Error recovery

**CodexBar Adaptation:**
```swift
// Our implementation (example)
actor SessionPersistence {
    func saveSession(_ session: SessionInfo) async throws {
        // Our keychain-based approach
    }
    
    func restoreSession() async throws -> SessionInfo? {
        // Our restoration logic
    }
}

// Inspired by quotio's session persistence approach
// Implemented using Swift concurrency and CodexBar's keychain utilities
```
