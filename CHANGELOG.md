# Changelog

## Unreleased

---

## [Windows] 0.25.1 - 2026-05-11

### Changed
- Align the Windows/Tauri release with upstream CodexBar 0.25.1 after reviewing the upstream patch set.
- Bump app, CLI, package, Tauri, and release metadata to 0.25.1 for the follow-up Windows artifact release.

### Notes
- Upstream 0.25.1 fixes macOS SwiftPM localization bundle lookup, macOS Keychain cache prompt churn, Pi session cost cache migration, Swift concurrency annotations, and standalone Swift CLI archive version fallback. Those code paths do not exist in the Windows/Tauri port, so no runtime Rust/Tauri logic change was required beyond the release alignment.

---

## [Windows] 0.25.0 - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Port upstream CodexBar 0.25 provider support for Manus, Xiaomi MiMo, Doubao, Command Code, Crof, StepFun, Venice, and OpenAI API balance into the Windows/Tauri app.
- Add v0.25 providers to the Rust provider registry, Settings provider list, credential/API-key catalog, CLI aliases, cookie/token-account handling, and provider icon registry.
- Add credit, request, refresh-credit, token-plan, purchased-credit, DIEM/USD balance, and OpenAI API credit-grants usage snapshots.

### Changed
- Update the provider catalog, CLI metadata, frontend provider unions, and release docs for 40 supported providers.

---

## [Windows] 0.24.0 - 2026-05-10

### Added
- Port upstream CodexBar 0.24 provider support for Codebuff, DeepSeek, and Windsurf into the Windows/Tauri app.
- Add Codebuff and DeepSeek API-key setup to Preferences, including provider icons, chart colors, CLI aliases, and release metadata.
- Add Windsurf local cached-plan usage reading from the Windows application data path.

### Changed
- Update the provider catalog, CLI help text, credential metadata, frontend provider unions, and release docs for 32 supported providers.

---

## [Windows] 0.23.11 - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- Handle Claude Web usage payloads that include overlapping design or routines alias fields without failing with a duplicate-field parse error.
- Keep Claude Web parse diagnostics useful without exposing raw response bodies in user-facing errors or logs.

---

## [Windows] 0.23.10 - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- Route active Claude OAuth token accounts through OAuth mode and pass the selected token directly into the Claude OAuth fetcher.
- Keep Claude `sessionKey` token accounts on the web/cookie path instead of confusing them with OAuth tokens.
- Report OAuth, Web, and CLI failures together in Claude Auto mode so a final CLI parse error no longer hides earlier token or cookie failures.

---

## [Windows] 0.23.7 - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Parse Claude CLI's exhausted `You've hit your limit · resets ...` short form as full session usage instead of reporting `Claude CLI did not return usage data`.
- Make Claude CLI usage parsing more tolerant of compact labels, decimal percentages, and remaining/available wording.
- Keep weekly reset lines from being promoted into the session reset when the session section has no reset.

### Security
- Re-enable the Tauri content security policy and disable global Tauri injection.
- Narrow the default Tauri capability permissions to the event, window, and global shortcut APIs the frontend actually uses.
- Harden external URL opening by validating web URLs and avoiding `cmd /c start` on Windows.

---

## [Windows] 0.23.5 - 2026-04-29

### Added
- Add safe diagnostics and credential storage status reporting without exposing secret values.
- Add a Windows installer smoke-test script for silent install, installed-file, registry, shortcut, and uninstall validation.

### Changed
- Reuse fresh provider refresh results during startup and panel opening to reduce avoidable provider fetches.

### Fixed
- Redact secret-like values from provider refresh errors before they cross the Tauri bridge.
- Re-verify downloaded installer SHA-256 hashes immediately before applying an update.
- Harden desktop command inputs for provider IDs, credential values, cookie source values, region values, token accounts, and filesystem paths.

---

## [Windows] 0.23.4 - 2026-04-29

### Security
- Default browser-cookie usage to manual mode so provider refreshes no longer read and decrypt browser cookie stores unless the user explicitly selects Automatic or imports cookies.
- Respect manual/off cookie-source settings when building provider fetch contexts, reducing behavior-based antivirus triggers around DPAPI browser-cookie access.
- Save local secret-bearing files through a secure-file wrapper; Windows writes are protected with DPAPI while existing plaintext files remain readable for migration.
- Redact raw provider response bodies and browser cookie-store paths from routine diagnostic logs.

---

## [Windows] 0.23.3 - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- Ship `WebView2Loader.dll` beside `codexbar.exe` in the Windows installer so clean installs can launch the Tauri shell.
- Replace the standalone portable executable release asset with `CodexBar-<version>-portable.zip`, which includes both `codexbar.exe` and `WebView2Loader.dll`.
- Add release workflow checks that fail the build when the WebView2 runtime sidecar is missing.

---

## [Windows] 0.23.2 - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- Accept a raw `__Secure-session` value for Ollama Cloud manual cookies instead of requiring a full `Cookie` header.
- Normalize Ollama token-account entries the same way, so saved accounts can use either raw `__Secure-session` values or full cookie headers.
- Clarify the Ollama cookie placeholder in the desktop settings UI.

---

## [Windows] 0.23.1 — 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- Add the provider Settings picker for the tray/menu bar metric so the Windows frontend can choose session, weekly, model-specific, tertiary, average, or Cursor extra-usage display modes.
- Make the tray icon respect per-provider metric preferences, including Cursor on-demand budget and legacy credits settings.

---

## [Windows] 0.23.0 — 2026-04-26

### Upstream 0.23 Parity
- Add Mistral usage support with monthly spend parsing from the Mistral Admin billing API, browser-cookie/manual-cookie auth, token-account storage, and provider branding.
- Add Claude Designs and Daily Routines usage windows when Claude OAuth/Web quota payloads include those limits.
- Add GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.5 Pro pricing for local Codex cost scanning.
- Prefer Cursor on-demand budget data for the extra/monthly cost metric when Cursor returns it.

### Windows Release
- Bump the Tauri desktop and shared Rust crate to `0.23.0`.
- Keep macOS-only upstream 0.23 work out of the Windows port: WidgetKit metadata, Sparkle appcast, AppKit menu sizing, and full-screen confetti are not applicable here.

---

## [Windows] 0.22.1 — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Stabilize the tray panel height measurement so provider refreshes and provider selection no longer visibly jump or re-anchor the popup.
- Close the tray panel when opening Settings or About so those windows can take focus cleanly.
- Keep the Windows DWM helper clean under `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

- Widgets: add WidgetKit extension backed by a shared app‑group usage snapshot.
- New local cost usage tracking (Codex + Claude) via a lightweight scanner — inspired by ccusage (MIT). Computes cost from local JSONL logs without Node CLIs. Thanks @ryoppippi!
- Cost summary now includes last‑30‑days tokens; weekly pace indicators (with runout copy) hide when usage is fully depleted. Thanks @Remedy92!

- ccusage-codex cost fetch is faster and more reliable by limiting the session scan window.
- Fix ccusage cost fetch hanging for large Codex histories by draining subprocess output while commands run.
- Fix merged-icon loading animation when another provider is fetching (only the selected provider animates).
- CLI PATH capture now uses an interactive login shell and merges with the app PATH, fixing missing Node/Codex/Claude/Gemini resolution for NVM-style installs.

- Unified menu bar icon mode with a provider switcher and Merge Icons toggle (default on when multiple providers are enabled). Thanks @ibehnam!
- Fix regression from 0.9.1 where CLI detection failed for some installs by restoring interactive login-shell PATH loading.

## 0.9.1 — 2025-12-19
- CLI resolution now uses the login shell PATH directly (no more heuristic path scanning), so Codex/Claude match your shell config reliably.

## 0.9.0 — 2025-12-19
- New optional OpenAI web access: reuses your signed-in Safari/Chrome session to show **Code review remaining**, **Usage breakdown**, and **Credits usage history** in the menu (no credentials stored).
- Credits still come from the Codex CLI; OpenAI web access is only used for the dashboard extras above.
- OpenAI web sessions auto-sync to the Codex CLI email, support multiple accounts, and reset/re-import cookies on account switches to avoid stale cross-account data.
- Fix Chrome cookie import (macOS 10): signed-in Chrome sessions are detected reliably (thanks @tobihagemann!).
- Usage breakdown submenu: compact chart with hover details for day/service totals.
- New “Show usage as used” toggle to invert progress bars (default remains “% left”, now in Advanced).
- Session (5-hour) reset now shows a relative countdown (“Resets in 3h 31m”) in the menu card for Codex and Claude.
- Claude: fix reset parsing so “Resets …” can’t be mis-attributed to the wrong window (session vs weekly).

## 0.8.1 — 2025-12-17
- Claude trust prompts (“Do you trust the files in this folder?”) are now auto-accepted during probes to prevent stuck refreshes. Thanks @tobihagemann!

## 0.8.0 — 2025-12-17
- CodexBar is now available via Homebrew: `brew install --cask steipete/tap/codexbar` (updates via `brew upgrade --cask steipete/tap/codexbar`).
- Added session quota notifications for the sliding 5-hour window (Codex + Claude): notifies when it hits 0% and when it’s available again, based only on observed refresh data (including startup when already depleted). Thanks @GKannanDev!

## 0.7.3 — 2025-12-17
- Claude Enterprise accounts whose Claude Code `/usage` panel only shows “Current session” no longer fail parsing; weekly usage is treated as unavailable (fixes #19).

## 0.7.2 — 2025-12-13
- Claude “Open Dashboard” now routes subscription accounts (Max/Pro/Ultra/Team) to the usage page instead of the API console billing page. Thanks @auroraflux!
- Codex/Claude binary resolution now detects mise/rtx installs (shims and newest installed tool version), fixing missing CLI detection for mise users. Thanks @philipp-spiess!
- Claude usage/status probes now auto-accept the first-run “Ready to code here?” permission prompt (when launched from Finder), preventing timeouts and parse errors. Thanks @alexissan!
- General preferences now surface full Codex/Claude fetch errors with one-click copy and expandable details, reducing first-run confusion when a CLI is missing.
- Polished the menu bar “critter” icons: Claude is now a crisper, blockier pixel crab, and Codex has punchier eyes with reduced blurring in SwiftUI/menu rendering.

## 0.7.1 — 2025-12-09
- Menu bar icons now render on a true 18 pt/2× backing with pixel-aligned bars and overlays for noticeably crisper edges.
- PTY runner now preserves the caller’s environment (HOME/TERM/bun installs) while enriching PATH, preventing Codex/Claude
  probes from failing when CLIs are installed via bun/nvm or need their auth/config paths.
- Added regression tests to lock in the enriched environment behavior.
- Fixed a first-launch crash on macOS 26 caused by the 1×1 keepalive window triggering endless constraint updates; the hidden
  window now uses a safe size and no longer spams SwiftUI state warnings.
- Menu action rows now ship with SF Symbol icons (refresh, dashboard, status, settings, about, quit, copy error) for clearer at-a-glance affordances.
- When the Codex CLI is missing, menu and CLI now surface an actionable install hint (`npm i -g @openai/codex` / bun) instead of a generic PATH error.
- Node manager (nvm/fnm) resolution corrected so codex/claude binaries — and their `node` — are found reliably even when installed via fnm aliases or nvm defaults. Thanks @aliceisjustplaying for surfacing the gaps.
- Login menu now shows phase-specific subtitles and disables interaction while running: “Requesting login…” while starting the CLI, then “Waiting in browser…” once the auth URL is printed; success still triggers the macOS notification.
- Login state is tracked per provider so Codex and Claude icons/menus no longer share the same in-flight status when switching accounts.
- Claude login PTY runner detects the auth URL without clearing buffers, keeps the session alive until confirmation, and exposes a Sendable phase callback used by the menu.
- Claude CLI detection now includes Claude Code’s self-updating paths (`~/.claude/local/claude`, `~/.claude/bin/claude`) so PTY probes work even when only the bundled installer is used.

## 0.7.0 — 2025-12-07
- ✨ New rich menu card with inline progress bars and reset times for each provider, giving the menu a beautiful, at-a-glance dashboard feel (credit: Anton Sotkov @antons).

## 0.6.1 — 2025-12-07
- Claude CLI probes stop passing `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, aligning with the default permission prompt and avoiding hidden first-run failures.

## 0.6.0 — 2025-12-04
- New bundled CLI (`codexbar`) with single `usage` command, `--format text|json`, `--status`, and fast `-h/-V`.
- CLI output now shows consistent headers (`Codex 0.x.y (codex-cli)`, `Claude Code <ver> (claude)`) and JSON includes `source` + `status`.
- Advanced prefs install button symlinks `codexbar` into /usr/local/bin and /opt/homebrew/bin; docs refreshed.

## 0.5.7 — 2025-11-26
- Status Page and Usage Dashboard menu actions now honor the icon you click; Codex menus no longer open the Claude status site.

## 0.5.6 — 2025-11-25
- New playful “Surprise me” option adds occasional blinks/tilts/wiggles to the menu bar icons (one random effect at a time) plus a Debug “Blink now” trigger.
- Preferences now include an Advanced tab (refresh cadence, Surprise me toggle, Debug visibility); window height trimmed ~20% for a tighter fit.
- Motion timing eased and lengthened so blinks/wiggles feel smoother and less twitchy.

## 0.5.5 — 2025-11-25
- Claude usage scrape now recognizes the new “Current week (Sonnet only)” bar while keeping the legacy Opus label as a fallback.
- Menu and docs now label the Claude tertiary limit as Sonnet to match the latest CLI wording.
- PATH seeding now uses a deterministic binary locator plus a one-shot login-shell capture at startup (no globbed nvm paths); the Debug tab shows the resolved Codex binary and effective PATH layers.

## 0.5.4 — 2025-11-24
- Status blurb under “Status Page” no longer prefixes the text with “Status:”, keeping the incident description concise.
- PTY runner now registers cleanup before launch so both ends of the TTY and the process group are torn down even when `Process.run()` throws (no leaked fds when spawn fails).

## 0.5.3 — 2025-11-22
- Added a per-provider “Status Page” menu item beneath Usage that opens the provider’s live status page (OpenAI or Claude).
- Status API now refreshes alongside usage; incident states show a dot/! overlay on the status icon plus a status blurb under the menu item.
- General preferences now include a default-on “Check provider status” toggle above refresh cadence.

## 0.5.2 — 2025-11-22
- Release packaging now includes uploading the dSYM archive alongside the app zip to aid crash symbolication (policy documented in the shared mac release guide).
- Claude PTY fallback removed: Claude probes now rely solely on `script` stdout parsing, and the generic TTY runner is trimmed to Codex `/status` handling.
- Fixed a busy-loop on the codex RPC stderr pipe (handler now detaches on EOF), eliminating the long-running high-CPU spin reported in issue #9.

## 0.5.1 — 2025-11-22
- Debug pane now exposes the Claude parse dump toggle, keeping the captured raw scrape in memory for inspection.
- Claude About/debug views embed the current git hash so builds can be identified precisely.
- Minor runtime robustness tweaks in the PTY runner and usage fetcher.

## 0.5.0 — 2025-11-22
- Codex usage/credits now use the codex app-server RPC by default (with PTY `/status` fallback when RPC is unavailable), reducing flakiness and speeding refreshes.
- Codex CLI launches seed PATH with Homebrew/bun/npm/nvm/fnm defaults to avoid ENOENT in hardened/release builds; TTY probes reuse the same PATH.
- Claude CLI probe now runs `/usage` and `/status` in parallel (no simulated typing), captures reset strings, and uses a resilient parser (label-first with ordered fallback) while keeping org/email separate by provider.
- TTY runner now always tears down the spawned process group (even on early Claude login prompts) to avoid leaking CLI processes.
- Default refresh cadence is now 5 minutes, and a 15-minute option was added to the settings picker.
- Claude probes/version detection now start with `--allowed-tools ""` (tool access disabled) while keeping interactive PTY mode working.
- Codex probes and version detection now launch the CLI with `-s read-only -a untrusted` to keep PTY runs sandboxed.
- Codex warm-up screens (“data not available yet”) are handled gracefully: cached credits stay visible and the menu skips the scary parse error.
- Codex reset times are shown for both RPC and TTY fallback, and plan labels are capitalized while emails stay verbatim.

## 0.4.3 — 2025-11-21
- Fix status item creation timing on macOS 15 by deferring NSStatusItem setup to after launch; adds a regression test for the path.
- Menu bar icon with unknown usage now draws empty tracks (instead of a full bar when decorations are shown) by treating nil values as 0%.

## 0.4.2 — 2025-11-21
- Sparkle updates re-enabled in release builds (disabled only for the debug bundle ID).

## 0.4.1 — 2025-11-21
- Both Codex and Claude probes now run off the main thread (background PTY), avoiding menu/UI stalls during `/status` or `/usage` fetches.
- Codex credits stay available even when `/status` times out: cached values are kept and errors are surfaced separately.
- Claude/Codex provider autodetect runs on first launch (defaults to Codex if neither is installed) with a debug reset button.
- Sparkle updates re-enabled in release builds (disabled only for debug bundle ID).
- Claude probe now issues the `/usage` slash command directly to land on the Usage tab reliably and avoid palette misfires.

## 0.4.0 — 2025-11-21
- Claude Code support: dedicated Claude menu/icon plus dual-wired menus when both providers are enabled; shows email/org/plan and Sonnet usage with clickable errors.
- New Preferences window: General/About tabs with provider toggles, refresh cadence, start-at-login, and always-on Quit.
- Codex credits without web login: we now read `codex /status` in a PTY, auto-skip the update prompt, and parse session/weekly/credits; cached credits stay visible on transient timeouts.
- Resilience: longer PTY timeouts, cached-credit fallback, one-line menu errors, and clearer parse/update messages.

## 0.3.0 — 2025-11-18
- Credits support: reads Codex CLI `/status` via PTY (no browser login), shows remaining credits inline, and moves history to a submenu.
- Sign-in window with cookie reuse and a logout/clear-cookies action; waits out workspace picker and auto-navigates to usage page.
- Menu: credits line bolded; login prompt hides once credits load; debug toggle always visible (HTML dump).
- Icon: when weekly is empty, top bar becomes a thick credits bar (capped at 1k); otherwise bars stay 5h/weekly.

## 0.2.2 — 2025-11-17
- Menu bar icon stays static when no account/usage is present; loading animation only runs while fetching (12 fps) to keep idle CPU low.
- Usage refresh first tails the newest session log (512 KB window) before scanning everything, reducing IO on large Codex logs.
- Packaging/signing hardened: strip extended attributes, delete AppleDouble (`._*`) files, and re-sign Sparkle + app bundle to satisfy Gatekeeper.

## 0.2.1 — 2025-11-17
- Patch bump for refactor/relative-time changes; packaging scripts set to 0.2.1 (5).
- Streamlined Codex usage parsing: modern rate-limit handling, flexible reset time parsing, and account rate-limit updates (thanks @jazzyalex and https://jazzyalex.github.io/agent-sessions/).

## 0.2.0 — 2025-11-16
- CADisplayLink-based loading animations (macOS 15 displayLink API) with randomized patterns (Knight Rider, Cylon, outside-in, race, pulse) and debug replay cycling through all.
- Debug replay toggle (`defaults write com.steipete.codexbar debugMenuEnabled -bool YES`) to view every pattern.
- Usage Dashboard link in menu; menu layout tweaked.
- Updated time now shows relative formatting when fresher than 24h; refactored sources into smaller files for maintainability.
- Version bumped to 0.2.0 (4).

## 0.1.2 — 2025-11-16
- Animated loading icon (dual bars sweep until usage arrives); always uses rendered template icon.
- Sparkle embedding/signing fixed with deep+timestamp; notarization pipeline solid.
- Icon conversion scripted via ictool with docs.
- Menu: settings submenu, no GitHub item; About link clickable.

## 0.1.1 — 2025-11-16
- Launch-at-login toggle (SMAppService) and saved preference applied at startup.
- Sparkle auto-update wiring (SUFeedURL to GitHub, SUPublicEDKey set); Settings submenu with auto-update toggle + Check for Updates.
- Menu cleanup: settings grouped, GitHub menu removed, About link clickable.
- Usage parser scans newest session logs until it finds `token_count` events.
- Icon pipeline fixed: regenerated `.icns` via ictool with proper transparency (docs in docs/icon.md).
- Added lint/format configs, Swift Testing, strict concurrency, and usage parser tests.
- Notarized release build "CodexBar-0.1.0.zip" remains current artifact; app version 0.1.1.

## 0.1.0 — 2025-11-16
- Initial CodexBar release: macOS 15+ menu bar app, no Dock icon.
- Reads latest Codex CLI `token_count` events from session logs (5h + weekly usage, reset times); no extra login or browser scraping.
- Shows account email/plan decoded locally from `auth.json`.
- Horizontal dual-bar icon (top = 5h, bottom = weekly); dims on errors.
- Configurable refresh cadence, manual refresh, and About links.
- Async off-main log parsing for responsiveness; strict-concurrency build flags enabled.
- Packaging + signing/notarization scripts (arm64); build scripts convert `.icon` bundle to `.icns`.
